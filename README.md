# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) using various data science techniques. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing two main scripts:
- `cltv.py`: Contains functions and calculations for CLTV.
- `cltv_prediction.py`: Focuses on building and evaluating predictive models for CLTV.

## Project Structure
- **cltv.py**: This script includes the core functions for calculating CLTV based on customer data.
- **cltv_prediction.py**: This script uses machine learning algorithms to predict CLTV. It also includes data preprocessing and model evaluation sections.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (for visualizations)
- seaborn (for visualizations)

You can install the requirements with:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
